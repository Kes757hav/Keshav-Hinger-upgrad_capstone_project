To install and execute the end-to-end pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Unzip the package and open 'FindDefault_upGrad_capstone_project.ipynb' file.
2. Install the required libraries by running 'Point 1 from table of content' code block from code file.
3. Run the 'Point 2 from table of content' block for retrive and understand data.(Note:- Before run this block code kindly keep the correct path of creditcard.csv file)
4. Then, we have a small description of Naive Byes with their example
5. Run the `Point 4 to 9 points from table of content' code to train and evaluate the model and get our observation with our model
6. Run the `Deployment phase ` code to make deployment on pipeline.

This solution benefits our company by providing an accurate and efficient way to detect credit card fraud. The model can be deployed in a production environment to analyze transactions in real-time, reducing the risk of financial losses and improving customer trust.
